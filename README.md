# Assignment-5.1-Checkers
Guidelines and Expectations
For this assignment, we will make a functional checkers game. 
Populate a board with checkers pieces and enable the board to allow a user to move pieces around the board. For our purposes in this assignment, the movements should be restricted to one square at a time. If you get that done quickly, then try to add the functionality of making more complex moves with the checkers' pieces so this could actually be used as a real checkers game on a website.
